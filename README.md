# 🎨 Tkinter GUI Project

Welcome to this Tkinter-based Python GUI project! This application showcases how to build interactive graphical user interfaces using Python's built-in `tkinter` module.

## 🚀 Features

- Built entirely using Python and the `tkinter` module  
- Interactive widgets and responsive GUI  
- Clean and user-friendly interface  
- Modular code structure for easy maintenance and extension

## 🛠️ Requirements

Make sure Python is installed on your system. This project uses:

- `tkinter` (pre-installed with Python)
- `IPython` (only if using Jupyter)

You can install any required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install ipython
```

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Open the notebook or convert it to a `.py` script.
2. Run the code to launch the GUI window.
3. Interact with the GUI to test the features.

## ▶️ Run Instructions

To run the project using Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook 19d2e55d-b7ff-4124-bf3b-2fdc57688ba8.ipynb
```

Or convert it to a Python script and run:

```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to script 19d2e55d-b7ff-4124-bf3b-2fdc57688ba8.ipynb
python 19d2e55d-b7ff-4124-bf3b-2fdc57688ba8.py
```
